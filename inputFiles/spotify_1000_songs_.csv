ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face   And it means something special to me   Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me   How lucky can one fellow be?      She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine   Who could ever believe that she could be mine?   She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue   And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?      And when we go for a walk in the park   And she holds me and squeezes my hand   We'll go on walking for hours and talking   About all the things that we plan      She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine   Who could ever believe that she could be mine?   She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue   And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  "
Foo Fighters,Freaks By Live,"If the mother goes to sleep with you   Will you run and tell geraldo   If the mother bears your children without tears   Without the usual costs of labor      If the mother goes to bed with you   Will you run and tell the neighbors   Will you hide behind that get up that you wear   Or will take te first ear that comes into contact with your blade   Like peter did on the hill      Will you call her a freak?   Will you call them freaks?      If the mother goes to bed with you   Will you run and tell the papers   How she picked you from a line up in downtown philadelphia   With a cigarette hangin' out of your mouth and henry miller in your back pocket   You little fucker      If the mother goes to bed with you   In the bowels of the cathedral   Will you render her asunder with what she really needs   Or will you crash that beautiful silence with some talk about   Finding yourself in you mother's arms      Will you call her a freak   Will you call them freaks   Or will you call them gods   Will you call them freaks      You know you sperm is weak   You never looked, so high   To ever find her so low   You did not have to go, that far   To show her you were holy      Now you know they're gonna come for you   And drag your silly name into the mud   If the mother bears your children without tears   And without the usual costs of labor      Will you call her a freak   Will you call them freaks   Or will you call them gods   Will you call them freaks  "

Kate Bush,Where Are The Lionhearts,"Destiny took me in her arms and told me:   ""You're a little lost on the fall.   You fall for all the men   You shouldn't fall for all at all. ""   Ooh, I know she knows, but still I go on,   Well, I'm a fool.      Climbing up the ladders   To slide down the adders   On the rocks,   On the rocks,   On the rocks,   On the rocks...      Joan of Arc walks into my mirror,   A burning sword.   I'd like to cry.   I look into her eyes.   I see she's seen the long days and night.   ""Ooh,"" she says,   ""The games are still the same, I see,   But they've changed the names now.   Are all Lionhearts put in parks, apart? ""      Lionhearts in the asylums,   Lionhearts tossed at sea,   Lionhearts who've lived their lives, like Arthur.   Lionhearts in cathedrals,   Lionhearts at mournings,   Lionhearts in every seed   But they're sown   On the rocks,   On the rocks,   On the rocks,   On the rocks...      Somebody I couldn't see   Tied me up and put me away,   Here on the rocks,   Here on the rocks,   Here on the rocks...  "

I'll fly away, oh glory,   I'll fly away   When I die, hallelujah, by and by   I'll fly away.

Joni Mitchell,This Flight Tonight,"Look out the left the captain said   The lights down there, that's where we'll land   I saw a falling star burn up   Above the Las Vegas sands   It wasn't the one that you gave to me   That night down south between the trailers   Not the early one   That you can wish upon,   Not the northern one   That guides in the sailors      Oh star bright, star bright   You've got the lovin' that I like, all right   Turn this crazy bird around   I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight      You got the touch so gentle and sweet   But you've got that look so critical   Now I can't talk to you baby   I get so weak   Sometimes I think love is just mythical   Up there's a heaven   Down there's a town   Blackness everywhere and little lights shine   Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down   Come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine      Oh star bright, star bright   You've got the lovin' that I like, all right   Turn this crazy bird around   I shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight      I'm drinking sweet champagne   Got the headphones up high   Can't numb you out   Can't drum you out of my mind   They're playing ""Goodbye baby, Baby Goodbye,   Ooh, ooh, love is blind""   Up go the flaps, down go the wheels   I hope you got your heat turned on baby   I hope they finally fixed your automobile   I hope it's better when we meet again baby      Star bright, star bright   You got the lovin' that I like, all right   Turn this crazy bird around   I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight  "
The Beatles,Nobody's Child,"As I was slowly passing   An orphan's home one day,   I stopped for just a little while   To watch the children play.   Alone a boy was standing   And when I asked him why,   He turned with eyes that could not see   And he began to cry.      I'm nobody's child,   I'm nobody's child.   Just like the flowers   I'm growing wild.   I got no mummy's kisses   I got no daddy's smile.   Nobody wants me,   I'm nobody's child.      No mummy's arms to hold me   Or sue me when I cry,   'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome   I wish that I could die.   I'll walk the streets of heaven   Where all blinds can see.      And just like for the other kids   It will be a home for me.      I'm nobody's child,   I'm nobody's child.   Just like the flowers   I'm growing wild.   I got no mummy's kisses   I got no daddy's smile.   Nobody wants me,   I'm nobody's child.  "
Patti Smith,Helpless,"[Originally by Neil Young]      There is a town in north Ontario,   With dream comfort memory to spare,   And in my mind   I still need a place to go,   All my changes were there.

Genesis,Visions Of Angels,"Standing in a forest gazing at the sun   Looking at the trees but there's not even one   See a rippling stream that smiles and then goes by   Run to feel its comfort but the water's dry.      I see her face and run to take her hand   Why she's never there I just don't understand   The trumpets sound my whole world crumbles down      Visions of angels all around   Dance in the sky.   Leaving me here   Forever goodbye.      As the leaves will crumble so will fall my love   For the fragile beauty of our lives must fade   Though I once remember echoes of my youth   Now I sense no past, no love that ends in love      Take this dream the stars have filled with light   As the blossom glides like snowflakes from the trees   In vengeance to a god no-one can reach      Visions of angels all around   Dance in the sky.   Leaving me here   Forever goodbye.      Ice is moving and the world's begun to freeze   See the sunlight stopped and deadned by the breeze   Minds are empty bodies more insensitive   Some believe that when they die they really live      I believe there never is an end   God gave up the world its people long ago   Why she's never there I still don't understand      Visions of angels all around   Dance in the sky.   Leaving me here   Forever goodbye.  "

Yngwie Malmsteen,Cry No More,There's a time for all our innocence   When the tears aren't far away   And a time to build a strong defense   When the boy's too old to play   And we learn the hard way   Day by day   Giving in but always coming back for more   And we cry no more...cry no more.   There's a time for games and visions   And the stake is more or less   There's a time for fast decisions   When our dreams become success.   We do anything to raise that score   Cause the end will always justify the means   And we cry no more.   Cry no more...and we cry no more   Our year's in misery   Made dreams reality. Ohh   And we cry no more   Cry no more...and we cry no more  
Megadeth,Bad Omen,"Down fell the stars and they splashed in the sea.   ""Mi nomine baphomet,"" come dance with me.   Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites.   Their master has come, the moon is full tonight.   Drinking, dancing, they worship and toast.   The Devil, who's watching, with demons remote.   Fire, rising, racing in your blood.   Possessed, naive, his service is done.   Bloody blasphemy   Sinister's the word as the demons take their fill.   An orgy's taking place, human blood will spill.   And act of worship as they conceive the ghouls.   Satan has their souls, they sing pagan tunes.   The ceremony is sure to be cursed.   They wait for his blessing but down comes the worst.   Their bodies, soulless, a corpse from the grave.   Their minds are helpless and no one can save them,   No one can save them.    "

Every night I've been hugging my pillow   Dreaming dreams of Amarillo   And sweet Marie who waits for me.   Show me the way to Amarillo   I've been weepin like a willow   Crying over Amarillo   And sweet Marie who waits for me.   Sha la la la la la la la   And Marie who waits for me.   There's a church bell ringing,   Hear the sound of joy that it's singing   For the sweet Maria   And the guy whos comin to see her.   Just beyond the highway   Lies an open plain   And it keeps me going   Through the wind and rain.   Is this the way to Amarillo?.............  "

The House of God   In awe I looked as time had stopped      Follow me   I had never seen a church like this before   ""This Place is terrible"" inscribed above the door   Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the church within      A few distant thoughts, inviting me in to sin   Nobody in the church... decay   Shrouded in a gloomy light, as if my final night   I wonder if God was ever here   Or did he turn away in fear, did he turn away in fear?

Squeeze,Heaven Knows,"You're no dame, I'm no duke   Somehow love is a fluke   We've survived thick and thin   Taking knocks on the chin   In the eyes of the sad   We may be barking mad   But the truth has been ceased   We are like chalk and cheese   You wind me up and I drive you mad   It's a fact of life, it goes hand in hand   And I know that look, it's read like a book   And I realize      I don't care what the world has to say   You should know that I love you   I love you   I love you today      When the boat starts to rock   Then my ears start to block   All the words that you say   Through the night, through the day   Where there's muck there is brass   And the storm soon will pass   Then it's back to the norm   All the cold turns to warm      Sometimes I think life crawls like a snail   And all of our dreams become the wind in your sails   Without wealth it's true, who cares what you do   And I realize      I can feel the eyes behind us as we walk   I can see the ears that listen when we talk  "

The Jam,Little Boy Soldiers,"Its funny how you never knew what my name was,   Our only contact was a form for the election.

You've gone and got yourself in trouble,   No you want me to help you out.      These days I find that I can't be bothered,   These days I find that its all too much,   To pick up a gun and shoot a stranger,   But I've got no choice so here I come, war games.      I'm up on the hills, playing little boy soldiers,   Reconnaissance duty up at 5:30.   Shoot shoot shoot and kill the natives,   You're one of us and we love you for that.      Think of honor, queen and country,   You're a blessed son of the British empire,   Gods on our side and so is Washington.      Come out on the hills with the little boy soldiers.   Come on outside, I'll sing you a lullaby,   Or tell a tale of how goodness prevailed.      We ruled the world, we killed and robbed,   The fucking lot, but we don't feel bad.      It was done beneath the flag of democracy,   You'll believe and I do, yes I do, yes I do,   Yes I do      These days I find that I can't be bothered,   To argue with them well what's the point,   Better to take your shots and drop down dead,   Then they send you home in a pine overcoat      With a letter to your mum   Saying find enclosed one son, one medal and a note,   To say he won.

Genesis,Window,"Crossing the mountains of truth see them   Shadows of night disappear   Rise from the slough of despond, find the pathway   Guiding us forward through pastures of dream day   Days to enjoy, peace I knew once before me   Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning   Come see me take my hand   Come see me in my land   Flying invisibly high, watch me   All on a beautiful sky, I'll be   Clear and serene in the love I've discovered   Long search is over, the soul is uncovered   Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing   Bidding farewell to the fears now decreased   Come see me take my hand   Come see me in my land   High on a golden crested wave she sits   The little nymphs dance in her hair   The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives   Horizons come to sip wine there   The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef   The albatross flies to the stern   And only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return   Crossing the mountains of truth see them   Soaring majestically high, and then   Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly   Thunder awakes me, it crashes beside me   Shatter the scene and bring chaos to beauty   Leading me forward where destiny may be   Come see me take my hand   View from another land    "

Christmas Songs,As Lately We Watched,"As lately we watch'd o'er our fields thro' the night,   A star there was seen of such glorious light.   All thro' the night, angels did sing   Carols so sweet of the birth of a King.      A King of such beauty was ne'er before seen,   And Mary His mother so like a queen.   Blessed be the hour, welcome the morn,   For Christ our dear Saviour on earth now is born.      His throne is a manger, His court is a loft,   But troops of bright angels, in lays sweet and soft,   Him they proclaim, our Christ by name,   And earth, sky and air straight are filled with his fame.      Then shepherds, be joyful  "

Yoko Ono,Kite Song,"I flew a kite, I held on tight to its string   Each time I go anywhere, I held on tight   In the middle of the night I woke up in fright   Thinking maybe in my dream I let go my kite      When I was in a restaurant talking to my friends   Watching their mouths move faster and faster   I thought of the kite that was flying the sky   And made sure that my hand was holding the string      That was long time ago   Many skies went by since then   Now my hands stopped holding anything   And I've learned to take a walk instead      Then one day in an evening light   I saw something strange shining bright   The sky was dark with swarms of larks   And in the midst of it all, yes, it was my kite      How did the kite get there? I never know   Floating away among the clouds to where nobody knows      I held my gun with both my hands   Slowly aiming at the shining dot   The shot went off, that dot blew off   Since then I've never seen the kite again  "

I feel like Geronimo   I used to be as trusting as Cochise   But the white eyes lies   He's out of whack with nature   And look how far his weapons reach!      Spirit of the water   Give us all the courage and the grace   To make genius of this tragedy unfolding   The genius to save this place.  "

Now the light has come   Breaking form the east   Someday we can find somewhere   To rest in peace.      I lost my control,   In a nightmare of being   Just a lonely soul   Without a hanging cross,   Standing all alone   Watching the lightning flash.  "

It is now 1831, and as always I am   absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite   sensations, to which end music is inessential. Since the comprehension   of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music, when combined   with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music.   Without music or an intriguing idea, colour becomes pallor, man becomes   carcase, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment   motionless.""

Patti Smith,Beneath The Southern Cross,Oh   To be   Not anyone   Gone   This maze of being   Skin   Oh   To cry   Not any cry   So mournful that   The dove just laughs   The steadfast gasps      Oh   To owe   Not anyone   Nothing   To be   Not here   But here   Forsaking   Equatorial bliss   Who walked through   The callow mist   Dressed in scraps   Who walked   The curve of the world   Whose bone scraped   Whose flesh unfurled   Who grieves not   Anyone gone   To greet lame   The inspired sky   Amazed to stumble   Where gods get lost   Beneath   The southern cross  
Marianne Faithfull,Nobody's Fault,"Treated you like a rusty blade   A throwaway from an open grave   Cut you loose from a chain gang   And let you go      And on the day you said it's true   Some love holds and some gets used   Tried to tell you I never knew   It could be so sweet   Who could ever be so cruel,   Blame the devil for the things you do.   It's such a selfish way to lose   The way you lose these wasted blues,   These wasted blues.      Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.   Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.      Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.   Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.      When the moon is a counterfeit   Better find the one that fits   Better find the one that lights   The way for you.      When the road is full of nails,   Garbage pails and darkened jails   And their tongues are full of heartless tales   That drain on you   Who would ever notice you   You fade into a shaded room ?   It's such a selfish way to lose   The way you lose these wasted blues   These wasted blues.      Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.   Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.   Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.   Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.      Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.   Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.   Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.   Tell me that it's nobody's fault   Nobody's fault   But my own.

Vince Gill,She Never Makes Me Cry,"I saw an old lover today on the street   She said, ""Do you remember how we used to be   On fire with that passion, we'd burn down those nights?""

Iron Maiden,Phantom Of The Opera,"I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp.   You've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask.   And you know and I know that you ain't got long now to last.   Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past.      You're standing in the wings, there you wait for the curtain to fall.   Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.   Yeah, I know that you're gonna scratch me, maim me and maul.   You know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call.      Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait.   Don't you stray, don't fade away.   Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may.   Don't you stray, from the narrow way.      I'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there.   You're the Phantom of the Opera, you're the devil, you're just out to scare.   You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air.   Haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair.  "

Fireflies dance in the heat of,   Hound dogs that bay at the moon.   My ship leaves in the midnight,   Can't say I'll be back too soon.      They awaken far far away,   Heat of my candle show me the way.   Tears of a thousand drawn to her sin,   Seasons of wither holdin' me in.      Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you.

And as I pulled you near, whispered in your ear, don't ever let it end.      Please promise me that this won't end.   Don't let it end.   Don't let it end.   Don't ever let it end.

Leonard Cohen,Came So Far For Beauty,"I came so far for beauty   I left so much behind   My patience and my family   My masterpiece unsigned      I thought I'd be rewarded   For such a lonely choice   And surely she would answer   To such a very hopeless voice      I practiced all my sainthood   I gave to one and all   But the rumors of my virtue   They moved her not at all      I changed my style to silver   I changed my clothed to black   And where I would surrender   Now I would attack      I stormed the old casino   For the money and the flesh   And I myself decided   What was rotten and what was fresh      And men to do my bidding   And broken bones to teach   The value of my pardon   The shadow of my reach      But no, I could not touch her   With such a heavy hand   Her star beyond my order   Her nakedness unmanned      I came so far for beauty   I left so much behind   My patience and my family   My masterpiece unsigned  "

Jason Mraz,Love For A Child,"There's a picture on my kitchen wall   Looks like Jesus and his friends involved   There's a party getting started in the yard   There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive   Was I too young to see this with my eyes?      By the pool last night, apparently   The chemicals weren't mixed properly   You hit your head and then forgot your name   And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain   And now your altitude and memory's a shame      [Chorus]   What about taking this empty cup and filling it up   With a little bit more of innocence   I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young   It's OK to be easily ignored   I like to believe it was all about love for a child      And when the house was left in shambles   Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass   Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around   Well I'm far too old to care about that now      [Chorus]      It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce   I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes   And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age   and they never check to see my grades   What a fool I'd be to start complaining now      [Chorus]      It was all about love...

Eric Clapton,One Chance,"Without wishing to cause you any pain   I got to push on through babe   And if I take the chance of seeing you again   I just don't know what I would do baby   And sometimes I think I'm gonna be just fine   All I got to do is go through it babe.      Then I hear those voices in the back of my mind   Telling me over and over and over that I blew it babe.      You had one chance and you blew it   You may never get another chance   You had the floor and you knew it   You can't blame it on your circumstance   At the risk of causing you a little pain   I'm going to have to forget you, babe   'Cause you broke my heart, left it out in the rain   And you'd the same again if I let you, babe.      I would give anything to hold you in my arms   But you know I can't do that, baby.      I guess I'll have to live with the choice that I have made   Even though deep down I still suspect that I blew it.  "

Manowar,Blood Of My Enemies,"Three sons have I, and they   Ride by my side. The fierce,   The black, and the wicked are   Their names we ride down my   Enemies on their half-hearted flight.   No voice of mercy no evangels of light.      Mighty messengers heathens rage   Witness our coming gods of the dead.

P!nk,Blow Me,"[Verse 1]   White knuckles and sweaty palms from hanging on too tight,   Clench of jaw, I've got another headache again tonight.   Eyes on fire, eyes on fire, and the burn from all the tears,   I've been crying, I've been crying, I've been dying over you.   Tie a knot in the rope, trying to hold, trying to hold,   But there's nothing to grab so I let go.

Zao,Endure,"I will endure.   It will endure in me.   Until the end forever,   I will endure.   If we continue in these ways,   Rebellion bends towards hatred.   We rise up for our cause   And forsake the outsiders.   Where is this love, this understanding?   Who will stand?   What will break down   If this uprise of self is left to reign? (This has chose?) for a standard to uphold.   An answer for the questions.   Wavering of beliefs lead to destruction.   Nothing remains constant to, to its origin.   But the unchanging faith of Christ,   The One stable since, since creation.   Thoughts have come and theories have gone.   Nothing has lasted through, through the resistance.   But can deny, who can dispute   The faith that's been throughout   Since the foundation of the beginning?   It has always been and will always be.   Forever.   It has been proven. it shall remain.   This faith has stood the test.   It persists through the conflict,   Through the revolt against its ways.   Nothing has held true like this.   No other has revealed such strength.   The roots deep within,   Entangling around my Rock.   Never letting go of this truth,   The power that sustained.   I will endure in what I believe, and what I believe   Will endure in me.  "

Religious Music,How Can I Keep From Singing?,"My life goes on in endless song   Above earth's lamentations,   I hear the real, though far-off hymn   That hails a new creation.      Through all the tumult and the strife   I hear it's music ringing,   It sounds an echo in my soul.   How can I keep from singing?      While though the tempest loudly roars,   I hear the truth, it liveth.   And though the darkness 'round me close,   Songs in the night it giveth.      No storm can shake my inmost calm,   While to that rock I'm clinging.   Since love is lord of heaven and earth   How can I keep from singing?      When tyrants tremble in their fear   And hear their death knell ringing,   When friends rejoice both far and near   How can I keep from singing?      In prison cell and dungeon vile   Our thoughts to them are winging,   When friends by shame are undefiled   How can I keep from singing?  "

But she always comes back for more, hanging her head and banging my door,   Johnnie comes back again.   I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, ""Please give me some medicine, man.""   Oh Johnnie comes back again.   Where'd she get that tear in her eye?   Whoever said she could leave me, where'd she learn to say good-bye?   She's been watching too much T.V., she only shows up for meals,   my medicine chest and my automobiles. Johnnie comes back again.   I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, ""Please give me some medicine, man.""   Oh Johnnie comes back again.      Me, I'm just an evil demon, I'm playing on her weakness,   counting on her sickness to bring her home again.      To use me up and to rob me blind, I guess it shouldn't surprise me.   Fighting and flashing like a fish on a line, my God, she must despise me.   But she always comes back again, now it won't be long 'til she's gone again,   Johnnie comes back again.      I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, ""Please give me some medicine, man.""   Oh Johnnie comes back again.  "

Translation:   I ran into God in a small cafe   Through cigarette smoke he appeared to me   Apologetic and blaze   He said: life is still worth living (you'll see)      He didn't look anything like my lover   Dejected, slightly out of place   Like shadows of constellation   He could hardly fill up space      But in the reddish twilight, hurried   To confess before the fall   Kiss the feet of all man-kind   And beg forgiveness of us all  "
Genesis,Your Own Special Way,"Go far enough and you will reach,   A place where the sea runs underneath.   And we'll see our shadow, high in the sky,   Drying away in the night.      I've sailed the world for seven years,   And left all I love behind in tears.   Won't you come here, wherever you are,   I've been alone long enough.      You, you have your own special way,   Of holding my hand keep it way 'bove the water,   Don't ever let go   Oh no, no, no.      You, you have your own special way,   Of turning the world so it's facing   The way, that I'm going, don't ever   Don't ever stop.      Whose seen the wind not you or I,   But when the ship moves she's passing by.   Between you and me I really don't think,   She knows where she's going at all.      You, you have your own special way,   Of carrying me twice round the world   Never closer to home than the day,   The day I started.      You, you have your own special way,   Hold onto my hand keep it way 'bove the water,   Don't ever let go   No, no, no.      What mean the dreams night after night.   The man in the moons' a blinding light.   Won't you come out whoever you are,   You've followed me quiet long enough.      You, you have your own special way,   Of holding my hand, don't ever let go.   You, you have your own special way,   Of turning the world so it's facing   The way that I'm going, don't ever,   Don't ever leave me.  "

Opeth,The Amen Corner,"White summer.   So far I have gone to see you again.   Hiding your face in the palm of your hands.   Finding solace in the words I do despise.   You snatch at every sound.   And even though you believe that I am shackled within death,   Memories are tainted with paleness.   Crestfallen still.   Those eyes, empty like a barren well.   It was the only task I would undertake.   To reap the harvest that was mine.   The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow,   And left me helpless in your embrace.   The bond we never spoke of, once stark and enticing,   Now slowly smoldering to dust.   The celestial touch, from grey to black.   A fathomless void enclosing.   Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs.   I can not endure. And so I rose from my sleep.   The moon turned away its face.   Overture of the long, black night begins   Something you said: ""Eerie circles upon the waters"".   Until now we have shared the same aura.   My ashes within your hands.   My breath in the sepulchral mound.   You know that your night is my day.   The final spark that blew life into me,   The demon of the fall.  "

Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,Dance Little Jean,"I played a wedding for the money,   And I wished that I could tell the bride and groom   Just what I thought of marriage   And what's in store after their honeymoon.      And I was grumblin' to the dancers   'Bout how men and women ought to live apart   And how a promise never made can not be broken   And can never break your heart      When suddenly from out of nowhere,   A little girl came dancing 'cross the floor,   And all her crinolines were billowing   Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore.   Oh what a joy fell on the honored guests   As each of them was drawn inside her dream,   And they laughed and clapped and stomped their feet   And hollered at her ""dance little jean""      Dance, little jean, this day is for you,   Two people you love, stood up and said ""I do""   Dance little jean, the prayer that you had   Was answered today   Your mama's marrying your dad      Well, my cynical heart just melted   'Cause I knew what this get together meant   How it ended year of tears and sad confusion   That the little girl had spent.   Well they told the band to pack it up   About the time the couple cut the cake,   But we played as long as they stayed   For love and laughs and little jeanie's sake.

They got it nailed down-Swiss tight!   The bank notes of Europe   The emperors and kings   Curl in the autumn as the burning of leaves   And I've cleaned my black guitar  "

Air Supply,Crazy Love,"When you are young, the thought of the day is   Kill some rhyme and how many ways to break the rules.   You laugh all the way, and grow up so fast that   Everyone says this kind of life you live cannot last.   And you smile as it's going past.   Each morning arrives, and so much is new   You can't wait to share it all with someone just like you.   The telephone rings, and friends come around and talk to the night   You see the world start to sing, and the fire inside you begins.      There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all   Watching time, all the things that you need so much   You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love      You live every day, as fast as it comes   And don't count the cost because, there is no other way.   These times will change, and people must grow but   Until you do, you live the only life that you know   And the wild fire lets you go.      There's nothing like crazy love, it comes and it goes,   Leaving you, with a feeling you never knew   At first it lasts, and then it's past, it's crazy love.      There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all   Watching time, all the things that you need so much   You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love  "

Megadeth,Ashes In Your Mouth,"People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads   And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads   Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall   Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall      Melting down all metals, turning plows and shears to swords   Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war   Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain   Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again      Where do we go from here?

The Jam,Private Hell,"Closer than close, you see yourself,   A mirrored image, of what you wanted to be.   As each day goes by, a little more,   You can't remember, what it was you wanted anyway.   The fingers feel the lines, they prod the space,   Your aging face, the face that once was so beautiful,   Is still there but unrecognizable,   Private hell.      The man who you once loved, is bald and fat,   And seldom in, working late as usual.   Your interest has waned, you feel the strain,   The bed springs snap, on the occasions he lies upon you,   Close your eyes and think of nothing but,   Private hell.      Think of Emma, wonder what she's doing,   Her husband terry, and your grandchildren.   Think of Edward, who's still at college,   You send him letters, which he doesn't acknowledge.   cause he don't care,   They don't care.   cause they're all going through their own - private hell.      The morning slips away, in a Valium haze,   And catalogs, and numerous cups of coffee.   In the afternoon, the weekly food,   Is put in bags, as you float off down the high street      The shop windows reflect, play a nameless host,   To a closet ghost, a picture of your fantasy,   A victim of your misery, and private hell      Alone at 6 o'clock, you drop a cup,   You see it smash, inside you crack,   You can't go on, but you sweep it up      Safe at last inside your private hell.   Sanity at last inside your private hell.  "

Billy Joel,River Of Dreams,"In the middle of the night   I go walking in my sleep   From the mountains of faith   To a river so deep      I must be looking for something   Something sacred I lost   But the river is wide   And it's too hard to cross      And even though I know the river is wide   I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore   And try to cross to the opposite side   So I can finally find what I've been looking for      In the middle of the night   I go walking in my sleep   Through the valley of fear   To a river so deep      And I've been searching for something   Taken out of my soul   Something I'd never lose   Something somebody stole      I don't know why I go walking at night   But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore   I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life   Until I find what it is that I've been looking for      In the middle of the night   I go walking in my sleep   Through the jungle of doubt   To a river so deep      I know I'm searching for something   Something so undefined   That it can only be seen   By the eyes of the blind      In the middle of the night      I'm not sure about a life after this   God knows I've never been a spiritual man   Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river   That runs to the promised land      In the middle of the night   I go walking in my sleep   Through the desert of truth   To the river so deep      We all end in the ocean   We all start in the streams   We're all carried along   By the river of dreams      In the middle of the night  "

Genesis,Stagnation,"To Thomas S.Eiselberg, a very rich man, who was wise   Enough to spend all his fortunes in burying himself   Many miles beneath the ground. as the only surviving   Member of the human race, he inherited the whole world.      Stagnation      Here today the red sky tells his tale,   But the only listening eyes are mine   There is peace amongst the hills,   And the night will cover all my pride.   Blest are they who smile from bodies free,   Seems to me like any other crowd   Who are waiting to be saved.      Wait, there is still time for washing in the pool,   Wash away the past   Moon, my long-lost friend is smiling from above,   Smiling at my tears.   Come we'll walk the path to take us to my home,   Keep outside the night.   The ice-cold knife has come to decorate the dead,   Somehow      And each will find a home,   And there will still be time,   For loving my friend   You are there   And will I wait for ever, beside the silent mirror   And fish for bitter minnows amongst the weeds   And slimy water.      I want to sit down.   I want to take a drink of water   I want a drink   I want a drink.   To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat.   I want a drink.   I want a drink.   To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts.   I want a drink.      Then let us drink   Then let us smile   Then let us go  "

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble,   They're only made of clay,   But our love is here to stay.  "

Yoko Ono,Looking Over From My Hotel Window,"Age 39, looking over from my hotel window,   Blue dots and red dots skating away in the park.   I used to be there twenty years ago,   Huffing over a mug hot chocolate drink.      Age 39, looking over from my hotel wind,   Wondering if one should jump off or go to sleep.   People tell you up is better than down,   But they never tell you which is up and which is down.      Age 39, looking over from my hotel wind,   95 pound bundle but it's trouble when there's nowhere to leave.   People say stardust and golddust are it,   But they never tell you it chokes you just as sawdust do.      Age 39, feeling pretty suicidal,   The weight gets heavier when you've bled thirty years.   Show me your blood, john, and I'll show you mine,   They say it's running even when you're asleep.      No trace of resentment, no trace of regrets,   One blood's thinner but both look red and fresh.   If I ever die, please go to my daughter   And tell her that she used to haunt me in my dreams.   (That's saying a lot for a neurotic like me.)      Age 39, looking over from my hotel window,   Trying to tackle away with heart of clay.   The weight gets lighter when there's nowhere to turn,   God's little dandruff floating in the air.      Age 39, looking over the world,   Age 39, floating over the world,   Age 39... Mm-mm... Floating along.  "

Ray Charles,Eleanor Rigby,"Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been   Lives in a dream   Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door   Who is it for?      All the lonely people   Where do they all come from ?   All the lonely people   Where do they all belong ?

All the lonely peopl   Where do they all belong  "

Jackson Browne,The Pretender,I'm going to rent myself a house   In the shade of the freeway   Gonna pack my lunch in the morning   And go to work each day   And when the evening rolls around   I'll go on home and lay my body down   And when the morning light comes streaming in   I'll get up and do it again   Amen.   Say it again   Amen.      I want to know what became of the changes   We waited for love to bring   Were they only the fitful dreams   Of some greater awakening?   I've been aware of the time going by   They say in the end it's the wink of an eye   When the morning light comes streaming in   You'll get up and do it again   Amen.      Caught between the longing for love   And the struggle for the legal tender   Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring   And the junk man pounds his fender.   Where the veterans dream of the fight   Fast asleep at the traffic light   And the children solemnly wait   For the ice cream vendor   Out into the cool of the evening   Strolls the Pretender   He knows that all his hopes and dreams   Begin and end there      Ah the laughter of the lovers   As they run through the night   Leaving nothing for the others   But to choose off and fight   And tear at the world with all their might   While the ships bearing their dreams   Sail out of sight      I'm gonna find myself a girl   Who can show me what laughter means   And we'll fill in the missing colors   In each other's paint-by-number dreams   And then we'll put our dark glasses on   And we'll make love until our strength is gone   And when the morning light comes streaming in   We'll get up and do it again   Get it up again      I'm gonna be a happy idiot   And struggle for the legal tender   Where the ads take aim and lay their claim   To the heart and the soul of the spender   And believe in whatever may lie   In those things that money can buy   Though true love could have been a contender   Are you there?   Say a prayer for the Pretender.   Who started out so young and strong   Only to surrender.      Say a prayer for the pretender   Are you there for the pretender?   Say a prayer for the pretender   Are you there for the pretender?   Are you prepared for the pretender?

UB40,Don't Slow Down,"You might believe, and still you feel the chase has just begun.   That you must reach that horizon before the setting of the sun.   You chase the light in front of you, nightfall close behind.   If you stop to catch your breath, you know what you will find.      [Chorus]   Don't slow down don't touch the ground.   You know what you will find.   That old grey man in tattered clothes following behind.      No time to stop, don't go to sleep, prepare to pay the cost.   The hours and minutes are passing by, another day is lost.   Impatience is a virtue, catch me if you can.   The seconds have been ticking by since your life began.  "

Manowar,March For Revenge,"Ride, ride, ride, ride up from hell      Armed with magic sons of demons and men   This song of greeting written for your tragic end.   So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear   Black winds blow where we ride near.   Maim and kill them, take the women and children.      Hot pitch and chain take to the air   Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.   Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.   Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.   Maim and kill them, take the women and children.      Fallen brother as I hold closed your side   I fear this wound your last.   Mighty earth now doth drink your blood   And I remember days long past.   Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep   For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.   For when we march, your sword rides with me.   For when we march, your sword rides with me.   For when we march, your sword rides with me.   For when we march, your sword rides with me.      You who killed my brother and all who take your side   This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.   Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane   Kill me if you can.      Death is life!      By the full moon they rise from their graves.   Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.   Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood   We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.   Maim and kill them, take the women and children.  "

Have you ever talked to someone,   And you feel you know what's coming next?   It feels pre-arranged.   'Cause you know that you've heard it before,   And you feel that this moment in time is surreal,   'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu.  "

Dead on arrival, but you can't believe the things you hear today.   I'll fly me a white plane over   Water -over blue and green and land in the ocean somewhere.      [Chorus:]  "
Marillion,Living With The Big Lie,"It all began with the bright light   The bright light and the noise   The chaos of the senses and the scream of desire      Touching and being touched   A million loose ends to tie up   Ticking of the clock and the cradle rock      The colours stand still   And then they move around   Comin' in and out of focus upside down      Empty winter trees   How space feels   Love of the soft ... the flowers and the sky      One fine day   The chaos subsides   Bleeds into awareness   And a lifetime of surprise      The beauty of your mothers eyes   The pain when you fall   You drink it in and marvel at it all   But you never really figure it out      You get used to it      The babble of the family   And the dumb TV   Roar of the traffic and the thunder of jets      Chemicals in the water   Drugs in the food   The heat of the kitchen and the beat of the system      The attitude of authority   The laws and the rules   Hit me square in the face, first morning at school      The heroes and the zeroes   The first love of my life   When to kiss and to kick and to keep your head down   When they're choosing the sides      I was never any good at it   I was terrified most of the time   I never got over it      I got used to it      Alone in the city at seventeen   With the hollow and the lonely   The drowning and the drowned   I was made to feel worthless   The wretched and the mean   Beat me up like a weapon I can't run away from or find a way round      Holdin' on, holdin' on      The greed and the missiles   Exploding somewhere every day   Hideous dark secrets under the sea and in holes in the ground      The cold war's gone   But those bastards'll find us another one   They're here to protect you, don't you know?   So get used to it   Get used to it!      The clash of religions   And the loaded prayers   Information   The face of starvation and the state of the nation      The sense that it's useless   And the fear to try   Not believing the leaders, the media that feed us   Living with the big lie      You get used to it   Get used to it!   It's okay, I got used to it  "

Grateful Dead,Brother Esau,"My brother Esau killed the hunter, back in 1969,   Before the killing was done his inheritance was mine.   When at first my brother walked away,   Before a weary band,   Esau gave his sleeplessness for a piece of moral land.   Our father favored Esau, he was eager to obey,   All the wild commandments, the old man shot his way.   But all this ended when, my brother failed at war,   He staggered home and found me in the door.   Esau he's on rollerskates today,   And he make a statement to someone in L. A.   Sometimes at night I dream, he's still that hairy man,   Shadow boxing the apocalypse, wandering the land.   Esau holds the blessing, brother Esau holds the curse,   I was thinking that the blame was mine,   But suspected something worse.   The more my brother looks like me, the more I understand,   The silent war it bloodied both our hands.   None of us can win.   Outside that dream, still that hairy man.   Well sometimes at night I think I understand.   Shadowboxing the apocalypse, wandering the land  "

Underoath,And I Dreamt Of You,"I see thy love in the distance   Breathless gasping for air, for in thy dreams you where   Awakening to the bleakness in my room   As my eyes begin to blear reality sets and starts the fear   For do dreams come true or do I die alone   Waiting like the petals of a wilting flower fall off   Until there is non and the once beautiful flowers dies naked   With no one to clothe it   Will I hold you in the grave or will the grave hold me?   The numbing dreams never end the swallow's wings still amongst   The idle wind   My colored world turns to grayscale   Recollecting the memories eyes covered hazel   Contradiction of thy thoughts standing calm love not lost   Searching till I find my princess whose passionate eyes cut right through me   For what is life if love only exists in thy thoughts?   What is romance if it is all fiction?   Nothing but a portrait left empty, a passing cloud of hurt   By to meet my love in the flesh is to find my whole heart   Your heart breaks though me your love is the key   Longing for my hearts door   To what day till I see sunrays shine upon your face   I dream of you the way you look   The beating of love in your heart   Your wolds are like the flowing of a spring, knowing thy love   Waits for me until eternity's end   Is this poetry or is this love's sickness   Engulfing my every being   Take the heart from you and the blood ceases from me   I see what you hear   Breathe taking the closest thing to me and my savior   Falling in love to a person I have never met but knowing she has salvation's fragrance   By God's grace this love will be free and able to fly away above   The earth to a point of exhaustion   But your breath will keep me alive   Words are pointless for this love is speechless   Preparing fro the curtains close   Laying their clutching hands so tight I can feel your heart   Telling me it will be all right   Ascension to heaven wehre this love can not only walk   But it runs through the endless fields of joy   Where love neither ends nor begins but flows everlasting   This was thy dream this daybreak and will by thy prayer   That I will rest sleepless till the sun rises on that day   And butterflies sing with us as we write love symphony   The pages of life fill the story of our love in a time long ago   Where fairy tales come true   And you and I, my love, will live happily ever after   I love you  "
Genesis,Domino,"The grey of evening fills the room,   No need to look outside,   To see or feel the rain.   I reach across to touch her,   But I know that she's not there.   Rain keeps running down the window pane.   Time is running out for me.      Can't you see what you are doing to me?   Can't you see what you have done?   As I try to pass another long and sleepless night,   A hundred crazy voices call my name,   As I try to pass them by,   I almost can believe that she is here,   In the glow of the night.      Do you know what you have done?   Do you know what you've begun?   Do you see we shall never be together again?   All of my life.      Lonely people, empty rooms,   Pointless violence, silent tombs.   Could it be that we shall be together again?      Sheets of double glazing help to keep outside the night,   Only foreign city sirens can cut through,   Nylon sheets and blankets help to minimize the cold.   But they can't keep out the chilling sounds.   Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming   That she is here with me?   In the glow of the night.      Do you know what you have done?   Do you know what you've begun?   Do you see we shall never be together again?   Lonely people, empty rooms,   Pointless violence, silent tombs.   Could it be that we shall be together again?      In silence and darkness   We held each other near that night   We prayed it would last forever.      Blood on the windows   Millions of ordinary people are there   They gaze at the scenery   They act as if it is perfectly clear   Take a look at the mountains   Take a look at the beautiful river of blood.      The liquid surrounds me   I fight to rise from this river of hell   I stare round about me   Children are swimming and playing with boats   Their features are changing   Their bodies dissolve and I am alone.      Now see what you've gone and done.      Now you never did see such a terrible thing   As was seen last night on T.V.   Maybe if we're lucky, they will show it again   Such a terrible thing to see   There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line   You've got to go domino.      Now I'm one with the living and I'm feeling just fine   I know what I must do   Play the game of happiness and never let on   That it only lives on in a song   There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line   You've got to go domino.      Do you know what you have done?   Do you know what you've begun?      In silence and darkness   Hold each other near tonight   For will it last forever?      There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line   You've got to go domino.  "
