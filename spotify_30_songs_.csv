ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face   And it means something special to me   Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me   How lucky can one fellow be?      She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine   Who could ever believe that she could be mine?   She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue   And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?      And when we go for a walk in the park   And she holds me and squeezes my hand   We'll go on walking for hours and talking   About all the things that we plan      She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine   Who could ever believe that she could be mine?   She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue   And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  "

Prince,"Beautiful, Loved And Blessed","Wake up   You're beautiful, loved and blessed   Feel me? (I think I do)      When you found me I was just a piece of clay   I was formless, you gave me a new name   With the breath of life I now live abundantly   All I needed was the potter's hand   And the blood on Calvary (that's right)      But to much power (tell it)   Can can sometimes turn to shame   To much desire   Sometimes makes you feel the same (come on)   But forgiveness is how you win the game   I begged for truth, now I know the truth   And that is when you came and said I was      Beautiful, loved and blessed   I'm better than the day before   Cause you made me confess that I am,   Beautiful, loved and blessed   When you're free you're really free indeed   All you gotta do is just plant the seed      A constant battle to stay ahead of the game   Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?   Always trying to break you down   Thinkin' that'll raise 'em up   I just wanna be happy   Come take this bitter cup from me      If I were ever to write my life story   I could truly say through all the pain and glory   I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand   Cause when you whispered in my ear   The words I so now understand, oh      Beautiful, loved and blessed   I'm better than the day before   Cause you made me confess that I am,   Beautiful, loved and blessed   When you're free you're really free indeed   All you gotta do is just plant the seed      Everything you made you said, ""That's good""   Before the fall of man you said, ""That's good""   Every time I walk in faith, that's good   You let me see another day, that's good   Before the earth was made you said,   ""Tamar, I will lead the way and you'll go far""   Knowledge and understanding   Understanding is good   And when I wake up in the morning   All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're      Beautiful, loved and blessed   When you rescue me from the darkness   And our heart just must confess   Beautiful, loved and blessed   When you're free you're free indeed   All you gotta do is just plant the seed      Hey, hey, hey   Wake up it's a new day   Hey, hey, hey   Wave you're hands in the air and say   Hey, hey, hey   Wake up it's a new day   Hey, hey, hey   Wave you're hands in the air and say      Beautiful, loved and blessed   You rescued me from the darkness in the wilderness   But I am beautiful, loved and blessed   No matter what the challenge   I always pass the test      That's what I am, beautiful   That's what I am, beautiful   I don't mean to put nobody down   Still I must confess that I am   Beautiful, that's what I am   That's what I am   When you wanna give up, don't cause you know   You always got a friend      That's what I am, that's what I am   That's' what I am   Beautiful, beautiful   That's what I am, that's what I am   That's' what I am   Beautiful, beautiful   Oh yeah, oh yeah   Beautiful, beautiful   Beautiful, beautiful  "

Point Of Grace,Without The Love Of Jesus,"Words by robert sterling music by john mandeville   Some think it all comes down to   Fate and circumstance   Life falls somewhere between   Accident and chance   Some seek solutions to the problems   They face   By hoping maybe someday, somehow   It will all fall in place   We keep persisting   Still something is missing   (chorus)   Without the love of jesus   The stars wouldn't shine   Rivers wouldn't run   And hearts beat out of time   Without the love of jesus   Tell me where would we be?   Lost on a lonely sea   Without the love of jesus   There's so much more to life than meets   The naked eye   It's no coincidence, no matter how we try   When we try to deny what we   Don't understand   Maybe that's when we fail to see god's   Providential hand   We keep persisting   Still something is missing   (repeat chorus)   It shouldn't take us a miracle   Before we finally see   That jesus' love is the only thing   That we will ever need   (repeat chorus)    "

Jimmy Buffett,"My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink And I Don't Love Jesus","[Chorus:]   My head hurts, my feet stink, and I don't love Jesus.   It's that kind of mornin',   Really was that kind of night.   Tryin' to tell myself that my   Condition is improvin' and if I don't   Die by Thursday I'll be roarin' Friday night.      Went down to the snake pit,   To drink a little beer.   Listened to the juke box,   Oh, it's comin' in clear.   All of a sudden I wasn't alone   Pickin' country music with old Joe Bones.   Duval Street was rockin',   My eyes they started poppin'!   Because there she sat at the corner of the bar,   As I broke another string on my old guitar.   Someone call a cab.   Lady won't you pay my tab?      [Chorus:]      Got to get a little orange juice,   And a Darvon for my head.   I can't spend all day,   Baby, layin' in bed.   I'm goin' down to Fausto's   To get some chocolate milk.   Can't spend my life in your sheets of silk   I've got to find my way   Crawl out and greet the day.      [Chorus:]  "

I wouldn't change a single thing   If I were you  "
Depeche Mode,It Doesn't Matter Two,As I lay here with you   The shame lies with us   We talk of love and trust   That doesn't matter      Though we may be the last in the world   We feel like pioneers   Telling hopes and fears   To one another      And oh what a feeling   Inside of me   It might last for an hour   Wounds aren't healing   Inside of me   Though it feel good now   I know it's only for now      The feeling is intense   You grip me with your eyes   And then I realize   It doesn't matter

They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry   So when I ask ""you want to leave the zip-code?""   Say ""sure"" and be me      [Chorus 1: Fabolous]   But this is my party   Stroll by if you want to   Or y'all can stay home   But why would you want to?      [Fabolous]   We gon' party, till we laid in graves   Sweat out our doobie braids and waves   Then scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""   That groupie made her wait   Cause when she seen the whips and chains   She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon      [Chorus 2: x2]   This is my party   So get fly if you want to   Get high if you want to cause I know you want to   Put your hands up as high as you want to   And if it feels good scream ""hey-hey-hey yo""      [Fabolous]   I don't know about y'all   But we doin' it over here   All the glasses got liquid that brewin' it over here   Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here   Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here   I can fit a few in a Rover's rear   We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this   You see why we asks is to see ID   Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access   Me I relax this (easy)   Cause I'm used to ballin'   You could tell that these guys need practice   But if it was a problem then I would confront you   You saying ""over"" bet ya I say ""you want to""   But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put   I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look   Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook   Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books      [Chorus 2]      [Fabolous]   Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale   Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell   If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell   For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well   And everybody, up north that's sick in jail   I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail   The Street Family speed off six SL's   To all them chicks at Yale ""hey-hey-hey-hey yo""   Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well   Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell   And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view   Girl I know that these guys say they want you   If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday   Same hoes from yesterday   Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday   Her hang-overs yesterday   You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today   But we had them Range Rovers yesterday      [Chorus 2]      [Fabolous]   Hey-hey-hey yo   Hey-hey-hey yo  "

Pink Floyd,Lost For Words,I was spending my time in the doldrums   I was caught in a cauldron of hate   I felt persecuted and paralyzed   I thought that everything else would just wait      While you are wasting your time on your enemies   Engulfed in a fever of spite   Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades   Like shadows into the night      To martyr yourself to caution   Is not going to help at all   Because there'll be no safety in numbers   When the right one walks out of the door      Can you see your days blighted by darkness?   Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?   Stuck in a world of isolation   While the ivy grows over the door      So I open my door to my enemies   And I ask could we wipe the slate clean   But they tell me to please go fuck myself   You know you just can't win  
David Allan Coe,The Purple Heart,I should get the purple heart for loving you after all the pain you put me through   When they start passing medals out to fools I will get the purple heart for loving you      There was nothing in the headlines to day you won the war   The one and only casually was me   You put me out of action so many times before   And left me on this battlefield to bleed   And I should get the purple heart...   [ steel ]   No one knows that I'm a hero there's no medals on my chest   All my wounds are hidden deep inside   I volunteered to love you hoping for the best   But all you ever done was cheat and lie   I should get the purple heart...   I should get the purple heart...
